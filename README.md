# Electric_Vehicle_Analysis

The project aims to analyze the electric vehicle market, focusing on both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). The goal is to provide insights into the market size, growth, and trends, as well as the technological advancements and efficiency of electric vehicles.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Total Vehicles: Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
- Average Electric Range: Determine the average electric range of electric vehicles to gauge technological advancements and efficiency.
- Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles: Identify and analyze the total number of BEVs and calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles.
- Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles: Identify and analyze the total number of PHEVs and calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles.

Visualization and Insights:
The project will include the following visualizations to provide insights into the electric vehicle market:
- Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards): A line/area chart illustrating the distribution of electric vehicles over the years, starting from 2010, providing insights into the growth pattern and adoption trends.
- Total Vehicles by State: A map chart showcasing the geographical distribution of electric vehicles across different states, allowing for the identification of regions with higher adoption rates.
- Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make: A bar chart highlighting the top 10 electric vehicle manufacturers based on the total number of vehicles, providing insights into the market dominance of specific brands.
- Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: A pie chart or donut chart illustrating the proportion of electric vehicles that are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, aiding in understanding the impact of incentives on vehicle adoption.
- Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model: A tree map highlighting the top 10 electric vehicle models based on the total number of vehicles, offering insights into consumer preferences and popular models in the market.

These visualizations and KPIs will provide a comprehensive understanding of the electric vehicle market, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and identify opportunities for growth and improvement.
